						Development Log #1 - Dec 22, 2019
					</h3>
					<center><p style="text-align:center;">Development is coming along nicely, I am fixing all of the bugs with the part placement system and will be working on making the rest of the ingame systems today if possible.
						Meanwhile here is a GIF of me removing Memory from the Motherboard. (When it moves up it is removed)</p></center>

					<h3 style="text-align:center;">Development Log #2 - Dec 23, 2019</h3>
					<center><p>The first showcase as to how the game could work in the future is up now. Please don't run off of the edge, I know there is no boundaries. If you have any bugs to report about the actual building system let me know. Also sensitivity is low and I won't change it till I implement custom controls.</p>

					<p>Controls: </p>

					<p>Movement: WASD </p>

					<p>Pickup: Left-Click</p>

					<p>Drop: E or Q</p>

					<h3 style="text-align:center;">Development Log #3 (BugFixes) - Dec 23, 2019</h3>
					<center><p>Everything has been rescaled, movement works better, a new part has been added (RMD Pyzen 1), objects no longer fly when making contact with the table or other objects. Selling is different now. Also the game closes if you have cheat engine running.</p>

					<h3 style="text-align:center;">Development Log #4 (Pre-Pre Alpha 2) - Dec 24, 2019</h3>
					<center><p>The next pre-pre-alpha version is out, all previous bugs are fixed. There is a known bug with collision so open all boxes you get from the store on the table and not on the floor or else things will clip through the floor. I am working on fixing that now. Yea also the Store is available. The developer console will show up showing an error. Just close it, it doesnâ€™t matter. You now have a room to work in and the market / selling algorithm is implemented and fixed to be a bit more realistic. There is no sorting in the shop yet so get used to it. Please let me know about any bugs you find in the game, and I will work on eliminating them while still progressing towards each update for the game. Have fun gamers.</p>

						<p>Controls:</p>

						<p>Open Box: E (Only when the box is not being held)</p>

						<p>Pickup Box: Left-Click (Same as normal)</p>

						<p>Open Shop / Store: Tab (Got bored and it kinda works so)</p>
