		<h1>Computer Builder Tycoon</h1>
		<h3>About Computer Builder Tycoon:</h3>
		<p>In Computer Builder Tycoon you make computers either for your buisiness or your clients that 
		you will chose from "missions" also known as contracts. Computer Builder Tycoon is a First Person game where you run a Computer Store in which you build, sell, 
		and maybe repair Computers if you want to. (It really is your choice to repair them) This game is being made in Unity 3D and is expected to be in development for 
		months and possibly up to a year. 
		<p>
			Dev-Logs will be posted every week to show progress on development
		The game is expected to be completely finished in about 5 months if development is concurrent with very little bumps and bruises in the way of progress. 
		I am currently working on everything in the game as I am a solo developer just looking to have fun making games and messing around with my own creations.</p>

		<h4>Development Roadmap: *Development is currently on hold due to my pc being broken*</h4>
		<p>
			To view development progress you can view the <a href="https://discord.gg/SX4w9Ws">discord</a> or the <a href="https://trello.com/b/OIX0bf2k/computer-builder-tycoon-roadmap">trello</a> page. I would recommend the <a href="https://discord.gg/SX4w9Ws">discord</a>, 
			because I keep the discord up to date with everything going on. You can even learn things about my life that you probably didn't know. 
			I plan to upload some devlog videos to YouTube so all of you can watch what I do just about everyday when I can.
